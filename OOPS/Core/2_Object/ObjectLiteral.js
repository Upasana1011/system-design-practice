// Objects are the core building blocks of OOP. 
// They represent entities with properties (data) and methods (functions) tied together.


// *  Using Object Literals:

const car = {
    brand: "Tesla",
    model: "Model S",
    drive: function () {
      console.log("Driving...");
    },
  };
  
  car.drive(); // Output: Driving...
