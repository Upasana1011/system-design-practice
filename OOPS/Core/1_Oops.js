//* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a paradigm that revolves around
//* organizing code into reusable and modular entities called objects. In JavaScript,
//* objects are dynamic and can be created in multiple ways, such as literals, classes,
//* or functions. Here's a thorough breakdown of OOP concepts in JavaScript, focusing
//* on the structure, syntax, and mechanisms.

//* Advantages of OOP in JavaScript:
//* Modularity: Code can be organized into reusable objects.
//* Reusability: Classes and prototypes promote reusing methods and properties.
//* Scalability: Easily extend existing code with inheritance or composition.
//* Maintainability: Encapsulation keeps implementation details hidden and provides a clean interface.
